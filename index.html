                    Our mission is to provide high quality therapy services to children with special needs to meet 
                    their comprehensive needs while providing a safe, therapeutic, fun environment where children can learn through 
                    experience and exploration.  In addition, our mission also includes supporting the family system by offering ancillary 
                    services (psychoeducational groups and coaching) to siblings and caregivers.
