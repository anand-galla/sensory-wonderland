                        <strong>Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) Therapy:</strong>  Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is the scientific approach 
                        that utilizes principles of learning to improve socially significant behaviors that include: reading, academic, social skills, 
                        communication, and adaptive living skills. ABA involves increasing skills and decreasing challenging behaviors. It is most often 
                        used with children with autism spectrum disorders, people with behavior disorders, multiple disabilities and severe intellectual disabilities. 
                        ABA is considered by many researchers and clinicians to be the most effective evidence-based therapeutic approach for the treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  
                        Insurance is accepted.  For more information about ABA therapy, please contact Yan Long, MS, BCBA at 901-218-5527.
